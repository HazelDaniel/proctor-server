 i make no excuse for my methods ma:

 i know where you stand ma. and everything you said resoates with me 100%

 i also understand that misunderstandings arise usually when the minor details are omited
 when comparing truths

 i beleve in the virtues of hard truths from hard conversations


 i knew i was going to be under pressure at some point in my life since 
 i didn't know i was running against a clock, if i had known i would have come to ibadan earlier

1. yahoo allegations
	i think i am prone to being misunderstood or stereotyped due to the inadequacies in my social abilities.
	i thought all these years of having conversations with you must have given me out


i have actually spent the last few years either learning or building
and there is a lot of proof to show for it

from my social media to the personal logs i keep on my computer


2. about the side hustle suggestions
- economy -> time
- works for everyone

all the impedances i encountered in my journey are quite explainable
